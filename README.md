# Starter Code

This repo provides the bare minimum template for CRA (no redux, eslint, husky, pre-commit hooks, or other utils).

It does include jest, RTL, JS-Dom, Jest-Jasmine test-runner config to allow [BDD-Lazy-Var](https://github.com/stalniy/bdd-lazy-var) for memoization test declarations, as well as setUpTests to house boilerplate configs for test runs, as well as coverage reports.

- Test: `yarn test`.
- Development: `yarn start`.
- Deployment: `yarn build`.

##### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
